# Overview 
As a developer I have a bucket list of projects that are in no way unique or novel but I would like to buil. One of them is an NES emulator, There are plenty of really good high qulaty emulators out there so I do not intend for this to be anything but a personal hobby project. I will updatet this readme as I work on it.
