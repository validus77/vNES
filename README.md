# vNES
# Overview
As a developer, I have a bucket list of projects that may not be unique or novel, but I still want to build. One of these is an NES emulator. While there are plenty of excellent, high-quality emulators available, this project is intended solely as a personal hobby. I will update this README as the project progresses.
